Description: The missRows package implements the MI-MFA method to deal with 
    missing rows in multi-omics data integration. The MI-MFA method generates 
    multiple imputed datasets from a Multiple Factor Analysis model, then the 
    yield results are combined in a single consensus solution. The package 
    provides functions for estimating coordinates of individuals and variables, 
    imputing missing row values, and various diagnostic plots to inspect the 
    pattern of missingness and visualize the uncertainty due to missing row 
    values.
